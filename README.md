# bacterialabundancevisual
Graphing the abundance of bacterial phyla and genera within each phylum:
Taking phylum abundance data from previous code (bacterialdatasorting), and rearranging to create a bar plot.
Sorting the genera from each phylum and creating a stacked bar plot of abundances of genera within certain phyla (eg: Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria), for each algal sample
Generating colourblind-friendly colour schemes for each bar plot.
